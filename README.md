# DECISION-TREE-REGRESSION

### IMPLEMENTION OF DECISION TREE REGRESSION USING SCIKIT-LEARN PYTHON LIBRARY TO PREDICT BODY FAT

- Decision tree regression observes features of an object and trains a model in the structure of a tree to predict data in the future to produce meaningful continuous output
- In this project, at first the dataset is loaded and pre-processing steps are carried out
- Then, by using DECISION TREE REGRESSOR MODEL from scikit-learn python library, the pre-processed data are trained and tested
- Finally, the output is predicted
